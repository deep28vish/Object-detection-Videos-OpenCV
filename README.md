Object Detection in Video- (OpenCV)
This is 2 of 3 notebooks check out the 1st notebook to learn about object detection and OpenCV for images- https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV

IMAGE detection in a video is same concept as image detection in images, as video is nothing but images flowing at 24 images per second.

Here again we will use classifiers by provided by OpenCV - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades

To avoid the clutter and make the output as smooth as possible we will use only 2 classifier in our vid.
