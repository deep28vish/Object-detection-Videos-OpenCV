# Object Detection in Videos using OpenCV

## About
This is 2 of 3 notebook that shows the use of OpenCV to detect objects in video. 
Fist notebook 1/3 shows the implementation of OpenCV to detect Object in images which can be found [here](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV). where as 3/3 notebook shows the same but this time the source of video is using a [webcam](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Webcam-OpenCV).

These are sample codes ready to run without any prior knowledge of AI, ML DNN, CNN these 50 lines are just plain simple ready to run.

## Requirements
* [Opencv(cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Cascade classifiers](https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-Detection-Images-OpenCV/tree/master/haar_cascades)
## Contents
* haar_cascades[Folder with all the required classifiers]
* OBJECT_DETECTION_VIDEO.py
* Object_detection_video.ipynb [detailed description]
* [Sample_input_video](https://www.vidsplay.com/peoplenyc.html)
* Output sample:
    * color.png
    * gray.jpg
    
## Inspiration
* [SENTDEX](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

## Takeaway
This is just to see how to load classifiers and execute it using OPENCV in python for Videos.
